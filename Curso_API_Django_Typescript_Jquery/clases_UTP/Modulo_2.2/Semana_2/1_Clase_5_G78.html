            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
            text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
            from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
            a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
            up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a 
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word 
            in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de 
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) 
            by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
            theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The 
            first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is 
            reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 
            1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are 
            also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
            English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
